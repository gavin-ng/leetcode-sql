# 626. Exchange Seats
https://leetcode.com/problems/exchange-seats/

## Description 
Mary is a teacher in a middle school and she has a table `seat` storing students' names and their corresponding seat ids.

The column id is continuous increment.
 

Mary wants to change seats for the adjacent students.
 

Can you write a SQL query to output the result for Mary?
 
```
+---------+---------+
|    id   | student |
+---------+---------+
|    1    | Abbot   |
|    2    | Doris   |
|    3    | Emerson |
|    4    | Green   |
|    5    | Jeames  |
+---------+---------+
For the sample input, the output is:
 

+---------+---------+
|    id   | student |
+---------+---------+
|    1    | Doris   |
|    2    | Abbot   |
|    3    | Green   |
|    4    | Emerson |
|    5    | Jeames  |
+---------+---------+
```

Note:
If the number of students is odd, there is no need to change the last one's seat.

## Solution

First, we can create a new `id` column that swaps the adjacent numbers by using the formula:
```
if id is Odd:
	id += 1
if id is Even:
	id -= 1
```

However, when there is an odd number of students, this formula will end up with a wrong id for the last student. Using the sample input, the list of `id` will become `1,2,3,4,6`.

Thus, we have to build in a conditional where we will not swap the id when there is an odd number of students. I decided to do this by declaring a variable:

```sql
DECLARE @n_students int
SET @n_students = (SELECT COUNT(id)
                FROM seat)
```

We can then use the modified formula:

```
if `id` is odd and there is an odd number of students:
	id (nothing is changed)
if `id` is odd and there is an even number of students:
	id -= 1 (we swap the students)
else (if `id` is even, we don't care about the total number of students):
	id += 1 

```

Here is the full solution:

```sql
DECLARE @n_students int
SET @n_students = (SELECT COUNT(id)
                FROM seat)
                
SELECT CASE WHEN id%2 != 0 AND @n_students = id
        THEN id
        WHEN id%2 !=0 AND @n_students != id
        THEN id + 1
        ELSE id - 1
        END
    AS id,
    student
FROM seat
ORDER BY id ASC
```

## Notes

1. % is the modulo operator. x%y returns the remainder of x/y. If it is zero, we know that it is an even number.
